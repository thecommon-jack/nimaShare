### General ###
###############
- Bash cares greatly about capitlization, but not at all about blank lines. Similarly, it cares greatly about spaces, so a=1 is good, while a = 1 is bad.
- Command options may be listed without additional dashes or spaces: -adl includes options a, d, and l.

- CTRL + C is abbreviated ^C. Entering data in a prompt and done now? ^D

- $REPLY is a system variable
- \r is a carriage return
- $0..$9 are system argument vars. When a command is executed with args, those become $1, etc. Note that $0 is the command itself. For example, hello.sh arg1 corresponds to $0 & $1.

### Commands ###
################
## cat ##
Concatenate. Can be used for that, or (concatenating) a listing of files in a folder, either the current or another. EX:

cat /etc/shells

will display the contents of the file "shells". 13 uses URL:
https://www.tecmint.com/13-basic-cat-command-examples-in-linux/


## ls ##
Lists. Common options:
-l	Long Format**
-h	human readable (just list the file names)
-t	sort by date modified
-1	(one, not L), forces one entry per line

** -l: The cryptic nonesense before each file name describes R/W attributes for user type. Ex:

drwxr--r--

d denotes that the object in question is a directory. Now by section:
rwx: the owner has the right to read (r), write (w) and execute (x)
r--: group members (users part of the editors group) have read-only permissions; write and execute are not permitted, as denoted by the hyphen characters (-)
r--: others (users aside from the owner or members of editors) have read-only permissions; write and execute are not permitted


## chmod ##
Modify permissions of a file or directory. 


## >, >> ###
Outputs to fileName, and overwrites original contents. If you want to append, use >>. Ex:

echo "Text to write" > ./jack/fileName.txt

If jack is a folder inside the current directory, that is. If working in the current directory, you can omit "./jack/". Absolute file path is ok, too. Can be used in script.


## pwd ##
Present working directory. Just tells you where you are. Can be used in script: $pwd


## HereDoc ##
Not the actual command name, but heredoc is a way to pass multiple lines to a command (like cat, commonly). Note that using $variables while SSH'd in means those variables act locally (like pwd). Very useful URL:
https://linuxize.com/post/bash-heredoc/

Ex:
cat << varName
PWD is: $(pwd)
Usr is: $(whoami)
varName

varName is just a start and end delimiter. Note that putting commands in () is b/c they're commands.


#################
### Scripting ###
#################
## echo ##
Using -e: BASH interprets backslash escapes, like \n for new line (which is different from carriage return, \r, which rewrites the line), \t for horizontal tab, and \v for vertical tabs.

## Comments ##
#is for single line. Colon space single quote : ' starts a multiline comment, and the single quote ' ends it.

## If/Else ##
Ex:
varName=10
if [ $varName -ne 24 ] && [ $varName -eq 10 ]
#could also [[ args && args ]], [ args -a args ], where -a means and, & -o means or (or use ||)
then
	echo "Less than 2"
elif (( varName < 11 ))
then
	echo "Less than 11"
fi

Parameters URL:
https://opensource.com/article/19/10/programming-bash-logical-operators-shell-expansions

If you want to use > instead of -gt, then you have to replace the [ ] with (( )). fi is just if spelled backward, like tac is cat spelled backward.


## Case ##
Ex:
carMake=Nissan
case $carMake in
	"BMW" )
		echo "It's a beamer." ;;
	"Nissan" )
		echo "It's a Knee Sawn." ;;
esac


## While ##
Ex:
num=1
while [ $num -le 5 ]
do
	echo $num
	num=$(( num + 1 ))
done

Note that until loops are pretty similar to while loops; while loops run while a condition is true, and until loops run until a condition becomes true.

## For ##
for (( i=0; i<5; i++ ))
do
	echo $i
done


## Break, Continue ##
In a loop, if you want to check that a condition is met (e.g.: if input is a variable), and then either go back to the start of the loop or exit the loop, use either continue or break, respectively. EX:
for (( i=0; i<=10; i++ ))
do
	if [ $i -eq 3 ] || [ $i -eq 7 ]
	then continue; fi #prints 0..10, except 3 & 7. if break, prints 0..2
	echo $i
done


############
## Arrays ##
############
Two types: indexed and associative. Former indexes from 0, latter functions as a dictionary. Associative URL: https://linuxhint.com/associative_array_bash/
Other useful URL: https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-use-arrays-in-bash-script

## Declaring ##
Associative. Must be declared using declare command. EX:
declare -A arrayName=( [indexName1]=varName1 [indexName2]=varName2 )
echo ${arrayName[indexName2]}

Indexed. May be declared using declare. EX: declare -a arrayName #note the lower case
May also be declared other ways: arName=(val1, val2) OR arName=( val1 val2 )

## Manipulation ##
To display all values in an array, use @ or *: echo ${arName[@]}
To display all keys in an array, use ! before: echo ${!arName[@]}
Can also be done in loop, so produces one key or value per line:
for key in "${arName[@]}"; do echo "$key"; done
or all at once: echo $@

Replace ! with # to return an integer size of the array.
Remove an entry: unset arName[1]
Append entry.
For indexed: arName+=(newValue1 newValue2)
For associative: arName+=( [key1]=value1 [key2]=value2 )
