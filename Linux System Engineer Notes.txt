Host1
192.168.128.107

Host2
192.168.128.133

Commands Used:
sudo vi /etc/hosts
Then we entered:
	192.168.128.107 Host1.localhost.com Host1
	192.168.128.133 Host2.localhost.com Host2
	
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname Host2.localhost.com
hostnames are like URLs are to IP addresses.

## Install Guest Additions ##
sudo yum group install -y --setopt=group_command=objects "Development Tools"
- Quotes because of the space.

Install kernel source:
sudo yum install -y kernel-devel
- Was already installed.

He goes on to talk about Guest Additions, but somehow this was already installed.

Commands to look up:
mount
fstab

To access your host's desktop, be sure you have Guest Additions installed, then in VM Manager, go to your settings for shared folders, and add your desktop folder under a name like hostDesk, and mount it to the same (that is, "hostDesk"). Then, booted into the VM, open and terminal and type:
sudo mount vboxsf hostDesk /home/jack/Desktop/hostDesk

Set Terminal to F11:
Find keyboard shortcuts in settings. Add new, name as you like. Command: "gnome-terminal" and assign key as you like.
Same for Nautilus, except the command is "nautilus"

Kerberos is a secure, 3-party authentication protocol used across almost all platforms.

## NTP ###
(network time protocol). Compensates for round-trip time, response time. If time is off between points, it adjusts in 0.5 ms/s if the diff is <= 128 ms. If up to 1k s diff, then NTP can step adjust. If >1k s, manual intervention (1k s = 16 2/3 min). Works in UTC only; time zones & Daylight Savings handled locally.

VM cannot often access external server, so relies on CPU clock, which is unreliable. Hypervisor (a VM host, like VirtualBox) can grant access via Guest Additions.

2 Types of NTP server: ntpd (legacy), and chronyd
ntpd supports all NTP4 modes (broadcast, multicast, manycast). chronyd does not.
chronyd better for intermittent network access, isolated networks. Faster than ntpd, & uses less memory.
##  ##

sudo yum install -y chrony #install chrony, check status of it:
sudo systemctl status chronyd

If not running:
sudo systemctl start chronyd

To enable at startup:
sudo systemctl enable chronyd
This only creates a symlink (like a shortcut and pointer combined) from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/chronyd.service to /usr/lib/systemd/system/chronyd.service

## chrony ##
chronyd is the server, chronyc is the client. d only accepts local queries by default, can be set up for IPv4 or IPv6.
##  ##

On Host1: ifconfig
This shows network IP of 192.168.128.107 w/ netmask of 255.255.255.0, making my network address 192.168.128.0

Open Vim: sudo vim /etc/chrony.conf
- 1st non-comment line says pool 2.blahblahblah, which means that chrony will resolve to a specific server from a pool of servers at startup.
- uncomment "allow 192.168.blahblah", and change to your network address (192.168.128.0/24) (24 represents bits, since 255.255.255.0 is 24 bits)

We can allow chronyc to control chronyd with "cmdallow 192.168.128.0/24" but that's not covered here.

If we wanted to sync two peers on the same network, we'd insert a line: "peer <ipAddressofPeer>", and the same in the peer's file. Note that we can specify pool, host, peer, server, and local in one file. Save and exit: esc : x!

Now allow external NTP requests by making a hole in the firewall: "sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service ntp" which does exactly as it reads; it permanently adds the ntp service to the public zone via the firewall-cmd command.

reload firewall settings: "sudo firewall-cmd --reload" and then check that the service has been added: "sudo systemctl status chronyd" Mine didn't match his; his listed ntp, mine listed something about a cockpit.

Over on Host2: sudo vim /etc/chrony.conf
comment out pool line (line 3), add "server 192.168.128.107 iburst" (ip address Host1). esc. :x! to save and exit.

restart chronyd: sudo systemctl restart chronyd
Ensure Host2 is set to use NTP by using time date ctl command: sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
