cd in Git repository:
get fetch #gets up to date with remote
git l #


commit is different from push!
	commit isn't sent; push is modifying the remote (the server).

Before you interact with the server:
git fetch #doesn't change your stuff, just in the .git directory
git lb #to make sure you're in the same place as the Master.

#look this up later: git rebase origin/master #changes my stuff to the most up-to-date version

tr 'a' 'b' #replace all a with b in array:
x=( aaa bbb ccc )
echo ${x[*]} | tr ' ' '|'

echo nima | tr '[a-z]' '[b-za]' #offset all letters in nima by one letter
