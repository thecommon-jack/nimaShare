# ***GENERAL COMMANDS***
# to print:         To print a blank line, use echo with no args.
echo Hello World! # can use single, double, or no quote marks. To use quotes:
echo Mom said \"hi\". # \ is the escape character.
# CTRL + C interrupts a command (like ping, which just goes on forever!)
# cp $var1 $var2 to copy, with var1 being the original, var2 the target
# rm to remove (delete)
# help [commandName]
# mkdir creates a directory
# clear is the same as DOS cls
# list of DOS equivalents:
# http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/unix_for_dos_users.html
# chmod (change mode). Ex: chmod 755 scriptName.sh
    # Note that 755 means "I can modify, all others an execute."
# If you want BASH to behave like DOS, for simple commands you can create an
# alias. Ex: alias cls=clear Put a series of these in a *.sh file, which will
# work for simple commands.
