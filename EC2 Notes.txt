Man there's a lot going on with AWS. Let's break it down. First up, this URL will get you to your management console:
console.aws.amazon.com/ec2

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html

Find your way to a new instance. This is just a placeholder section for now.

SSH into your instance using a key.pem file (not necessarily that name):
ssh -i Key01.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-20-239-151.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Note that everything after the @ will change every time you stop and start that instance, so go to your EC2 console and copy the new into that spot.

Next, this Linux is redhat, so apt is replaced with yum. Install tmux, a utility you'll use to pair program, using this command:

sudo yum install tmux

Look up tmux pair programming and land on this page:
