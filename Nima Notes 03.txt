What is the use of ulimit?
used for setting limits on #processes, other resources. Not really useful right now.

What are the other four main git commands? Fetch, push, pull, commit.

## Fetch ##
Updates your local view (updates parts of .git to do with this particular remote) of Origin. Basically updates an index. To see where you are, try git lb first.

## Pull ##
May screw things up if changes aren't simple, especially if Origin and I went in different directions (not the same as different places!). Better to use git rebase.

## Rebase ##
I'll come to this later.



origin: you point to this.
Master: the master branch.
Get updates since your last fetch.

git commit
git push
git add. Flags a file to be committed. a git  file that doesn't exist in remote Origin/branch Master, or for 

## Commit ##
To add something your local repository. If someone is using you as their remote branch, they could now see it if they git fetch. To push to Origin/Master, you first have to commit. Commit creates a log. If you don't commit a file, git ignores changes you made to that file.

git commit opens vim. You have to add a description. 72 characters first line, blank line, then 82 characters if you need more. Save. Exit. (:wq)

## Log ##
git log. Shows changes timeline. Now git lb to see current status, then git push, then git lb again to see that origin & master are up to date with you.

bo back and find that link Nima sent you that had the XKCD comic in it. THat's got more info.

git status tells you what's been modified since your last commit.
git diff tells you what the differences are between two files.

To push something means to put your updated copy of a file on your Origin / Master.

Origin: just a repository which I pull from (github is my remote, my origin, though there's no specific reason to call it that except that it's a centralization of an otherwise decentralized process). Master: just a local name, the default, for the branch I'm pointint to in my remote (in this case, Origin).

What is a socket?

What's the difference between a dictionary and a hash table and a hash map?
